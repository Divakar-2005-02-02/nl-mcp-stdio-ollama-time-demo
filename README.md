## 📄 Overview

This project shows how to use Model Context Protocol (MCP) with .NET. It allows you to connect server-side tools and use them on a client. You can also send the results to a local Ollama-hosted LLM for processing and generating answers. This is a practical example to help you understand how these components work together.
